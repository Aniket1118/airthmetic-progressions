//program to find the nth number of airthmetic progression


//suppose we have  A.P = 1,2,3,4,5
// where first term a = 1 and difference (d) = 1 and we have to find the 10th number of this AP,, so
//we know nth no. of an AP is TN = a + (N-1) * d

var a =1;
var d = 1;
var n = 10; //nth no. of AP which we want to find
var c =   (a + (n-1) * d);
